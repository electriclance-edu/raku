---IDEAS---
[GAMEPLAY MECHANIC]
- Farms (and other structures) aren't tiles, but instead multiblock structures.
[GAMEPLAY MECHANIC]
- Research is done by exploring a Map of Knowledge. The level of research the player can do is dependent on the size of their Map.
- The Map is a physical structure. A 1x1 map can be produced like:
                            x  x  x
                            x  o  x              (wherein x = SUSTAIN
                            x  x  x              and o = MIND)
A 1x1 map will be able to research only a Theory of Knowledge.
- Theoretically, the amount of resources required to maintain a larger and larger Map is exponential.
-
[GAMEPLAY MECHANIC]
- Libraries are formed by merging a STORAGE and MIND.

---PROBLEMS---
1. replacing with air doesnt work

<div class="textPopup">

  <h2>I find myself awake beneath unfamiliar skies,</h2>
  <p>...and yet I do not even know what familiar means.
  <br><br>
    There is a gnawing emptiness clawing at the back of my mind, as if something precious had been ripped apart from my very being. Something inherently feels wrong with myself, with this world.
    <br><br>
    It may be best to first understand where exactly I am.

  <p class="technicalText">CONNECTING TO DRONE FEED...</p>
  <h2>A grand structure splits the sky in half.</h2>
  <p>
    As the clouds part across it's monolithic, featureless form, the drone feed suddenly cuts off. Something seems to be interfering with the center's capability to communicate with the device - something unnatural. <br>
    <br>
    It might be worth trying to send another drone to attempt to explore, though it'll probably disable the same way.
